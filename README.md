# Custom-Hooks-Countdown-App
## Day 44  
I will now begin to create my own custom hooks and find their usage in apps where my code can be repeatable quite often. I will create a new file called hooks under the  components file and there i will construct my 'new hook'. ***IMPORTANT RULE HERE TO REMEMBER IS THAT ALL NEW HOOKS MUST AT ALL TIMES BEGIN WITH use AS A STARTING TEXT***. Next i will work on how to use my custom hooks and how to configurate them. My use-counter.js file(hook) then looks like this after making it reusable  ![Screenshot_2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90603989/177189802-d7da86eb-cd15-4f38-8216-12814b5db346.png)
